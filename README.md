# Trigrams

### Codefellows 401 Python Course Assignment

Objective: Take a piece of text of arbitrary size and create new text using trigrams. Trigram analysis is very simple. Look at each set of three adjacent words in a document. Use the first two words of the set as a key, and remember the fact that the third word followed that key. Once youâ€™ve finished, you know the list of individual words that can follow each two word sequence in the document. These words are then implemented in an heuristics algorithm to create new text.
